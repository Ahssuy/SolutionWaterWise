This is the code to the project targeting the Problem Statement -

Enabling Year-Round Agriculture through Sustainable Irrigation Solutions Farmers on the outskirts of Mumbai, Maharashtra, face severe irrigation challenges due to their reliance on rain-fed water sources. This limits cultivation to just three months of the year, leaving farmland idle for the remaining months. As a result, farmers experience reduced productivity, economic instability, and are often forced to seek low-paying, temporary jobs outside agriculture. Many wish to return to farming as their primary livelihood but lack the tools and technology for sustainable, year-round irrigation. Additionally, prolonged periods of idleness and overuse have led to deteriorating soil health, further compounding the problem. Without innovative water management solutions, farmers struggle to maximize their agricultural potential and improve their livelihoods.

Objective: Participants are tasked with creating innovative, scalable, and sustainable irrigation solutions to enable year-round farming for farmers in Mumbai’s outskirts. The solutions should focus on rainwater harvesting, atmospheric moisture harvesting, and AI-driven water optimization to ensure efficient water capture, storage, and usage.

Our team developed an AI-powered irrigation assistant. Using machine learning, we analyze real-time sensor data from irrigation machines to predict water needs precisely. Through a simple .NET MAUI app, farmers receive personalized insights — when to irrigate, how much water to use, and how to care for their soil. Integrated with Gemini AI, the app acts like a virtual irrigation coach — offering sustainable tips, modern techniques, and water footprint reduction strategies. It’s like having an agricultural expert right in their pocket.
